Interface
=============

General
------------

``Theme``: This setting changes the colour scheme that RMG's user-interface uses. It does not affect games

``Icon Theme``: This setting changes the colour of the icons shown at the top of RMG's interface (eg: ``Start ROM``)

``Check for updates``: Controls whether RMG will automatically check for updates. If an update is found, RMG will prompt the user before installing it

``Discord Rich Presence``: If Discord is installed, your friends will (by default) be able to see which N64 game you are currently playing
