Interface
=============

General
------------

``Theme``: This setting changes the colour scheme that RMG's user-interface uses. It does not affect games

``Icon Theme``: This setting changes the colour of the icons shown at the top of RMG's interface (eg: ``Start ROM``)

``Check for updates``: Controls whether RMG will automatically check for updates. If an update is found, RMG will prompt the user before installing it

``Discord Rich Presence``: If Discord is installed, your friends will (by default) be able to see which N64 game you are currently playing

Emulation
------------

``Hide cursor during emulation``: This option will hide the cursor when it is hovering over the N64 game. If the game isn't full-screen, you'll be able to make the cursor re-appear by dragging it to the top or bottom of the screen

``Hide cursor during fullscreen emulation``: This option will hide the cursor during fullscreen emulation. By default you can exit fullscreen emulation using alt+enter (this can be changed in Hotkeys>View)

``Pause emulation on focus loss``: Emulation will be paused if RMG is minimised or if another window is clicked

``Resume emulation on focus gain``: Emulation will be resumed when the RMG window is clicked. This has no effect if ``Pause emulation on focus loss`` is disabled

``Automatically switch to fullscreen on emulation start``: Games will launch in full screen mode. By default you can exit fullscreen mode using alt+enter (this can be changed in Hotkeys>View)
