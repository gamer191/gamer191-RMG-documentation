Interface
=============

General
------------

``Theme``: This setting changes the colour scheme that RMG's user-interface uses. It does not affect games

``Icon Theme``: This setting changes the colour of the icons shown at the top of RMG's interface (eg: ``Start ROM``)

``Check for updates``: Controls whether RMG will automatically check for updates. If an update is found, RMG will prompt the user before installing it

``Discord Rich Presence``: If Discord is installed, your friends will (by default) be able to see which N64 game you are currently playing

Emulation
------------

``Hide cursor during emulation``: This option will hide the cursor when it is covering emulated games. If the game isn't full-screen, you'll be able to make the cursor re-appear by dragging it to the top or bottom of the screen

``Hide cursor during fullscreen emulation``: This option will hide the cursor whilst games are full-screen. By default you can exit full-screen mode using alt+enter (this can be changed in Hotkeys>View)

``Pause emulation on focus loss``: Emulation will be paused if RMG is minimised or if another window is clicked

``Resume emulation on focus gain``: Emulation will be resumed when the RMG window is clicked. This has no effect if ``Pause emulation on focus loss`` is disabled

``Automatically switch to fullscreen on emulation start``: Games will launch in full-screen mode. By default you can exit full-screen mode using alt+enter (this can be changed in Hotkeys>View)

``Ask for confirmation during drag and drop``: RMG plays ROMs that are "drag and dropped" into it (this can't be disabled). If this option is enabled, RMG will ask for confirmation if an existing game is running, to prevent games being accidentally closed.

``OpenGL type``: Changes whether games are run using `OpenGL` or `OpenGL ES`. There is no need to change this setting unless you are unable to load any ROMs

``Statusbar message duration``: The status bar is shown at the bottom of RMG's user-interface. It shows emulator-related messages, such as "emulation paused". This option controls how long those messages are shown for (in seconds)
